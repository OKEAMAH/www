  **[AI4Democracy Day](https://www.eventbrite.es/e/entradas-ai4democracy-day-890329919757)** \
  Location: IE Tower \
  Time: 18:00 CEST

  Join us on May 21 at the [IE Tower](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/study-in-madrid/ie-tower/) in Madrid for AI4Democracy Day, an event that will bring together Alicia Combaz (founder and CEO of Make.org), [Audrey Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang) (first Digital Minister of Taiwan and one of "TIME100 Most Influential People in AI"), [Glen Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Weyl) (founder and Research Lead of the Plural Technology Collaboratory, a Microsoft Research Special Project) and other leaders who are using AI to enhance democracy.

  In the context of an unprecedented election year, with about half of the world’s population heading to the polls, deepfakes, bots, and misinformation powered by AI pose a significant risk to the integrity of democracies worldwide. But AI can also empower citizens to shape their society.

  In their latest book [*⿻ 數位 Plurality*](https://www.plurality.net/), Tang and Weyl explain that AI systems should be based on democratic values such as transparency, explainability, plurality, and freedom. With the goal of promoting AI systems that champion democratic values and increase information sharing on this topic, the event will feature a series of short, interactive sessions with AI leaders.

  Join a thought-provoking dialogue with E. Glen Weyl, a visionary in reimagining market mechanisms and societal structures, and Audrey Tang, a trailblazer in government digital transformation. This session will explore the intersection of technology and governance, examining innovative approaches to enhancing civic engagement and public discourse. Engage with these pioneering thinkers as they share insights on creating more inclusive and participatory political ecosystems for the future.

  Location: Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, 1 Place de la Porte de Versailles \
  Time: 14h25 - 15h10 \
  Stage 3

  Amidst the backdrop of numerous elections unfolding worldwide, the intersection of technology and democracy takes center stage. From the risks of algorithmic biases, to concerns about surveillance, the need for technology that upholds democratic principles has never been more pressing. How can we ensure we design tech that empowers marginalized voices and fosters inclusion? How can it support citizens’ fundamental right to privacy? And how can governments develop frameworks that support these rights and values, rather than hinder them?

  Time: 17:00 CEST

  The Technology and Global Affairs Innovation Hub of Sciences Po, the Bertelsmann Stiftung, and the RadicalxChange Foundation are happy to invite you to join an international conference on Scaling collaborative technology to enable the future of multilateralism. The event will take place on 23 May 2024 at 5pm on the campus of Sciences Po.

  **Conference Description**

  Amidst concerns about the disruptive effects of technology on global governance, our gathering seeks to highlight its transformative potential in fortifying the resilience of democratic systems. Taiwan stands as a beacon of innovation, harnessing agile technology to advance democracy, pluralism, and citizen well-being. Central to our discussions is the concept of "Plurality," offering a framework to understand and maximize the benefits of technological progress.

  In this critical juncture for democracy, mid-way through this year punctuated by elections around the globe, we raise essential questions: How can we reconcile the existential challenges posed by technology with our democratic values? What new technological architectures can we forge to enhance international dialogue and cooperation? Drawing from local deliberative and participative democratic experiences, how can we cultivate global cooperation in an increasingly interconnected world?

  **[BlockSplit: Digital Democracy Day | PLURALITY](https://blocksplit.net/plurality/)** \
  Location: AC Hotel by Marriott Split

  **Plurality, Digital diplomacy & Regulation**

  Dive deep into the future of interconnection of collaborative technology and plural democracy.

  **About Plurality**

  The concept of plurality, encompassing democracy, technology, and social progress, highlights the interconnectedness and diversity within human societies.

  Plurality promotes a flexible and adaptive approach, leveraging technology to facilitate meaningful interactions and collective decision-making.

  This event will expand beyond regulation and explore innovative solutions for democracy.

  **​This is the 3rd part of our Digital Democracy Day.**

  A unique event where Web3 builders, legal experts, European regulators, and policymakers meet to explore topics such as digital diplomacy, plurality, crypto regulation, and digital identity, fostering insightful discussions and collaborations at the intersection of technology and governance.

  **​What is digital democracy?**

  Digital democracy refers to the use of digital technologies in order to engage citizens in democratic processes. It encompasses various tools and platforms that enable citizens to communicate with government officials, express their opinions, participate in decision-making processes, and access information about public policies and issues. 

  ​A key component of digital democracy is plurality, which emphasizes the importance of embracing diversity and complexity in democratic societies, leveraging decentralized technology and innovative approaches to foster collaboration, progress, and social cohesion.

  **How to Participate**

  This event is invitation only. It’s intended for thought and political leaders, regulators and experts in democracy and web3 governance, decision making and privacy.

  **Fireside Chat – Plurality: Technology for Collaborative Diversity and Democracy** \
  Location: Wikimedia Deutschland e. V., Tempelhofer Ufer 23/24, 10963 Berlin \
  Time: Doors Open: 14:30 | Fireside Chat: 15:00 - 17:30 | Get-Together: 17:30 - 18:00

  Jointly organized and hosted by Agora Digitale Transformation, SUPERRR Lab, RadicalxChange Foundation, and Wikimedia Deutschland.

  There is a limited number of seats available, please inquire with RadicalxChange team for availability. 

  Drawing on their new book titled “*⿻ 數位 Plurality*” which will be published on May 20 2024, we will talk with Audrey Tang and Glen Weyl about how the relation between democracy and digital technology has changed over the past decades and what they envision for the future. And most importantly: How can we get there?

  Format: Our conversation features Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister (2016-2024), and Glen Weyl, a researcher and founder of RadicalXChange. The conversation will begin with a segment moderated by Stefan Heumann from Agora Digitale Transformation and Julia Kloiber from Superrr Lab. Following this, we will open the discussion to the audience, allowing them to participate and ask questions. The event will adhere to Chatham House Rules. After the fireside chat, attendees are invited to a get-together with snacks and drinks.

  The goal is to foster a real conversation and engagement rather than a sequence of statements on different topics. We will seek to structure the question and the conversation in a way that both Audrey and Glen can engage with their respective perspectives.

aboutAudreyBody: |
  Named to “TIME100 Most Influential People in AI”, Audrey Tang served as Taiwan’s first Digital Minister and the world’s first nonbinary cabinet minister. As a child, Tang practiced Taoism to moderate all strong emotions to survive a cardiac condition. After attending 10 educational institutions in 10 years, Tang left formal schooling to pursue self-education at age 14. In her 20s, Tang rose to prominence as a leader in free and open-source software, revitalizing the Haskell and Perl programming languages. During her 30s, Tang played a crucial role in shaping g0v (gov-zero), one of the most prominent civic tech movements worldwide. In 2014, Tang helped broadcast the demands of Sunflower Movement activists, and worked to resolve conflicts during a three-week occupation of Taiwan’s legislature. Tang became a reverse mentor to the minister in charge of digital participation, before assuming the role in 2016 after the government changed hands. Tang helped develop participatory democracy platforms such as vTaiwan and Join, bringing civic innovation into the public sector through initiatives like the Presidential Hackathon and Ideathon. Her other accomplishments include shaping Taiwan’s internationally acclaimed COVID-19 response, as well as safeguarding its 2024 presidential and legislative elections from foreign cyber interference.
