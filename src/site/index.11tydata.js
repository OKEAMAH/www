    title: "Rethinking Art Ownership: In Conversation With Serpentine & RxC",
    description: `March 21st, 17:30 GMT | 10:30 AM PDT

Art enriches society through the weaving of relations between the cultures that create it, and the cultures that receive it. Conventional ownership and private property rules undermine such interactions in the context of art understood as a public good, constraining liquidity and alienating artists from the very communities that should be their allies: collaborators, neighbourhoods, collectors and supporting institutions. We recently published a blog post that discussed some of the most explicit pinch points within the existing art economy and argued for the need to initiate a new chapter in rethinking art ownership by introducing it from the perspective of Partial Common Ownership.

Join RxC and Serpentine UK in a discussion with the authors of the post: Victoria Ivanova (Serpentine UK), Matt Prewitt (RxC), and Paula Berman (RxC | Host).`,

    title: "Beyond Cultures of Ownership: Emerging Strategies for Interdependence",
    bodyText: `**RadicalxChange & Serpentine Arts Technologies with Dark Matter Labs & Somerset House co-host a one-day gathering in London on 3 Nov 2023.**

Join us on the 3rd of November, 2023, at Somerset House, London, to explore and strategise how art and culture can play an active part in reconfiguring ownership. We see ‘ownership’ as the underlying power dynamic of our time that can either create or block possibilities for rebalancing our relationships with technology, the planet, and one another.

We invite artists, activists, researchers, technologists, and policymakers active and interested in connecting the dots between cultural production, political economies, and systems change. By creating a space for all of us to come together from different contexts, we hope to sketch out connections between new imaginaries and practises that instigate more plural and relational protocols for interdependence.`,
