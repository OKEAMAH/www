# RxC Wiki Project Governance

## Issues

Anyone may request changes to the RxC Wiki by opening a GitHub issue. To request that new content be added to the Wiki, use the [Wiki page proposal](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/www/issues/new?assignees=&labels=wiki+page&template=wiki_request.md&title=) issue template.

## Pull Requests

Anyone may propose changes to the RxC Wiki.
The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request.

All pull requests must be approved by the Web Director. If a pull request is endorsed ("seconded") by at least one triager, the Web Director must respond with one of the following actions:

1. accept the pull request

2. request changes to the pull request

3. deny the pull request and provide reasoning for doing so

## Triagers

Triagers assess newly-opened issues in the [RadicalxChange/www][]
repository. Triagers are given the "Triage" GitHub role and have:

* Ability to label issues and pull requests
* Ability to comment, close, and reopen issues and pull requests

Any RadicalxChange community member who has attended one or more RxC events (e.g. community calls, conferences, meetups, etc.) and made a few contributions to the RxC Wiki project (commenting on Issues, PRs, Discord, etc.) may apply to become a triager by opening an issue.

## RadicalxChange Foundation

The RadicalxChange Foundation has final authority over this project, including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting

### Web Director

RadicalxChange Foudation may appoint a Web Director to act on its behalf.

All pull requests will require final approval from the Web Director. This is to avoid breaking changes to the website and to provide a final check on content published by RadicalxChange Foundation.

The current Web Director is @alexrandaccio, Technical Director of RadicalxChange Foundation.
